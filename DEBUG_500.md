# üîç DEBUG: API Error 500

## Good News! ‚úÖ
You're now logged in properly (no more 401!)

## Problem: 
Server is crashing when processing the image (500 error)

## What to Check:

1. **Look at your Flask terminal** - There should be a Python error/traceback showing what went wrong

2. **Common causes:**
   - Face recognition library not loaded
   - No registered students with face images
   - Image processing error
   - Missing temp directory

---

## Please Send Me:

**The error message from your Flask terminal** 

It will look something like:
```
Error in api_attendance_detect: ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line ..., in api_attendance_detect
    ...
SomeError: ...
```

This will tell me exactly what's wrong!

---

## Quick Checks:

**Check 1:** Are there students registered with face images?
**Check 2:** Does the `temp/` folder exist?
**Check 3:** Is Flask showing any errors in terminal?

---

Send me the terminal output and I'll fix it immediately!
