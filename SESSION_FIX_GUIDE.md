2. **Cookie Blocked** - Browser blocking session cookies
3. **Wrong Role** - Logged in as student/admin instead of faculty
4. **Multiple Tabs** - Session conflict from multiple tabs

   python start_app.py
   ```

4. **Check Terminal Logs:**
   Look for these debug messages:
   ```
   Session contents: {...}

## üìã **Verification Checklist**

Before using attendance:
- [ ] Logged in as FACULTY user (not student/admin)
- [ ] Can see dashboard properly
- [ ] Session not expired (logged in recently)
- [ ] Only one browser tab open
- [ ] Cookies enabled in browser
- [ ] Using supported browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)

## üö® **Still Not Working?**

### **Check These:**

1. **Are you definitely logged in as faculty?**
   ```
   - Look at top right corner
   - Should show faculty name
   - Role should be "Faculty"
   ```

2. **Is Flask app running?**
   ```
   - Check terminal for errors
   - Should see "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
   ```

3. **Database has faculty users?**
   ```bash
   python test_session.py
   # Shows all faculty users
   ```

4. **Check session config in app.py:**
   ```python
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False  # Should be False for localhost
   SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'
   ```

---

## üí° **Prevention Tips**

To avoid this error in future:

1. **Don't stay logged in too long** - Session expires after 1 hour
2. **Use one tab only** - Multiple tabs can cause session conflicts
3. **Logout properly** - Use logout button, don't just close browser
4. **Regular logins** - Login fresh each day
5. **Clear cache periodically** - Prevents stale data

---

## üîê **Security Note**

This error is actually a **good thing** - it means:
- ‚úÖ Your system is checking authentication properly
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized users can't access attendance
- ‚úÖ Sessions are being validated
- ‚úÖ Security is working as intended

---

## üìû **Debug Mode**

To see detailed session info:

1. Look at your terminal where Flask is running
2. When you click "Start Camera", you'll see:
   ```
   Session contents: {'user_id': 3, 'role': 'faculty', ...}
   Session has user_id: True
   Session role: faculty
   ```

3. If you see:
   ```
   Session contents: {}
   Session has user_id: False
   ERROR: No user_id in session!
   ```
   ‚Üí **You need to login again!**

---

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior**

When working correctly:
1. Login as faculty
2. Go to attendance page
3. Select class
4. Click "Start Camera"
5. Camera starts ‚úÖ
6. Face recognition works ‚úÖ
7. No 401 errors ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ **Quick Test**

Run this to verify you can login:
```bash
python test_session.py
```

This shows all faculty accounts you can use.

---

**TL;DR: Just logout, close browser, login again as faculty, and try again! 99% of the time this fixes it.** üòä
